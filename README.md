# Data-Mining-II-Project


The Wine Quality dataset was used to build machine learning models using Python in Google Colab. The important libraries used in this study were sci-kit learn, pandas, numpy, and plotly. A large language model, ChatGPT, was used to assist in creating code to aggregate, visualize, and generate models. The models created were aimed to generate models, like Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost to predict wine quality based on 12 different dimensions. The features of the wine in the dataset were: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, and quality. Through pre-processing, feature reduction, and hyperparameter tuning, the model with the lowest mean squared error was chosen. 


The train and test data are in the repository to reproduce experiments. The report is also in the repository as well for more insight.
