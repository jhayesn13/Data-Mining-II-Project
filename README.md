# Data-Mining-II-Project
Supervised Learning project where mine quality was predicted on certain features. The Goal of the project was to optimize the model to have the lowest MSE.

The Wine Quality dataset was used to build machine learning models using Python in Google Colab. The important libraries used in this study were sci-kit learn, pandas, numpy, and plotly. A large language model, ChatGPT, was used to assist in creating code to aggregate, visualize, and generate models. The models created were aimed to generate models, like Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost to predict wine quality based on 12 different dimensions. The features of the wine in the dataset were: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, and quality. Through pre-processing, feature reduction, and hyperparameter tuning, the model with the lowest mean squared error was chosen.
